# Heart_Disease_detection

**Overview :**

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict the presence of heart disease in patients using various health-related features. The project utilizes a logistic regression model to achieve this goal and provides an interactive system to test the predictions.

**Requirements : **

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab Notebook
Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn

**Dataset : **
The dataset used in this project is assumed to be a heart disease dataset with features that may include age, gender, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, resting ECG results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, the slope of the peak exercise ST segment, number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy, and a thalassemia condition.

**Attribute Information**

age = age in years

sex = (1 = male; 0 = female)

cp = chest pain type (4 values)

trestbps = resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)

chol = serum cholestoral in mg/dl

fbs = (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)

restecg = resting electrocardiographic results(values 0,1,2)

thalach = maximum heart rate achieved

exang = exercise induced angina

oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest

slope = the slope of the peak exercise ST segment

ca =number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy

thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect
